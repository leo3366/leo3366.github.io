Lahns wield the Noble Sword and Crescent Pendulum. The Noble Sword and Crescent Pendulum are connected by a long cloth or chain, allowing Lahns to freely attack from all directions. Lahns are agile and quick on their feet, and can quickly deliver devastating attacks by swinging their Crescent Pendulum. By careful manipulation of the swinging motion, they can even deliver back attacks with the Crescent Pendulum from the front as well as various combo attacks.
