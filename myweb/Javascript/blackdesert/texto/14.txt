Witches are known for their prudence in battle. In exchange for the casting time delay, they can perform large-scale magical attacks. Their thorough moves will burn, freeze and shatter their enemies with the power of natural elements such as fire, ice, wind, lightning, and earth. After Awakening, They can use the Aad Sphera to gain even great control over earth and lightning, and can summon the Earth and Lightning guardians.
