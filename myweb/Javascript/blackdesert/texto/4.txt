Warriors are skilled fighters with both good attack and defense. Using the Sword and Shield as their main weapons, they are the best weapon-wielders among all the classes. During battle, Warriors will show off their fearlessness with storm-like barrage of melee combat moves. After Awakening, they use two-handed Great Swords to deliver devastating blows to their enemies.
