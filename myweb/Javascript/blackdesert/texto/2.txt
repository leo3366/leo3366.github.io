Strikers are hand-to-hand combatants who attained their skills through countless street brawls. From heavy punches to powerful kicks, their martial arts skills are matchless. After Awakening, they can use the Gardbrace on their both arms, and can also summon Echo Spirits to ambush their enemies from all sides.
