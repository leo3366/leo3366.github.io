Valkyries are armed with sword, shield, and divine magic. They can use their weapons to powerful blows to their enemies. They can also use their divine magic for healing and empowering allies. After Awakening, they can use Lancia, a weapon that is even taller than a Valkyrie and greatly boosts her great offense and defense.
