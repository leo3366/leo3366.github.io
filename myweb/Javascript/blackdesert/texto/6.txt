Rangers are the specialists of ranged archery attacks. Under the grace of the Sylphs, Rangers present swift movement in any situation of battle. Most of their skills are based on preventing enemies' attempt of melee approach. The Sylph's mystic power is the source of their ability. After Awakening, they can wield the Kamasylven Sword to use melee type attacks.
