Kunoichis use sword, martial arts, and Ninjutsu. Their swarm of attacks consists of swift movement, smoke shells, and unique skills such as hiding and pulling the enemy into the middle of total chaos. With proper control, a Kunoichi can flip the battle by discreetly raiding important figures. After Awakening, they can use the Sah Chakram to attack their enemies before they even realize what’s hit them.
