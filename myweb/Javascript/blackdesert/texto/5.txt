Sorceresses can effectively control the battlefield with dark magic by using both melee and ranged attacks. They lure enemies with ranged magic and lead them to a chaos and painful demise once they come closer. Other races revere and fear the Sorceresses. After Awakening, they can use dark magic shroud themselves in darkness, and use a giant Scythe to cut down their enemies.
