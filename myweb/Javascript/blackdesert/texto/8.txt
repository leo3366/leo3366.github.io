Tamers can fight enemies at any range. With the support of Heilang, the divine beast, Tamers can perform ruthless combination attack with Heilang, or take the enemy down themselves while borrowing the divine force from the beast. After Awakening, they can use the Celestial Bo Staff to channel the divine power as the true master of Heilang.
