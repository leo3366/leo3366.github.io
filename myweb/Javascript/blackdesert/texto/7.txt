Berserkers wield monstrous double-axes as big as their own bodies. Berserkers overwhelm their enemies with their size and outrageous strength, annihilating them with ease. Although their physique makes them slow-moving, improved skills will compensate for that. After Awakening, they can use the Iron Buster to send powerful blasts at the enemy, almost like a small portable cannon.
