Mystics are hand-to-hand combatants who attained their skills after countless years training in the East. From heavy punches to powerful kicks, their martial arts skills are matchless and elegant. After Awakening, they can channel the aura of the Sea Dragon to deliver powerful blows with the pair of Cestus on their arms.
